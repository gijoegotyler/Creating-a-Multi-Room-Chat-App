# Creating-a-Multi-Room-Chat-App
A chat app that is capable of serving many rooms.
This project was made as a precursor to the my Multiplayer Game as just a basic test for a simplified networking structure.

# Version 1.1
Hooray Multi-Room Functionality has been added

# Doing this yourself
This is a very simplified version and would make for a great project for newbies at node.js.
**BTW: You are not able to just download and run this project**

# Node Packages
I used path, http, express, and sockets.io.

# Changes to be made
* I am working on a ui for room switching.
* I am going to make a second more complex repository for a backend way of controlling the rooms.
* I also want to add a username feature and update the css.

**BTW: You are not able to just download and run this project.**
**It requires node.js and the packages mentioned in the node packages section.**
